<h1>Hello World! Welcome to my Github Page!</h1>
<p> My name is Gili Remen and I am a Journalism and Global Studies double major with a business minor at Lehigh University. Here is a sampling of the different types of Data Journalism that I have created. This github site was created for my Visaual Communications class, where I learned how to make all these amazing data visualizations with different programs. I'm hosted with Github Pages.</p>

<h1> Infographic </h1>
As a student at Lehigh Univeristy and a journalist on campus, I was interested to see how diverse our student body actually is. After doing some research I made an infographic to represent our student body ethnic diversity (or lack thereof) on campus.

<h1> Timeline </h1> 
<p> For a majority of my childhood, Barack Obama was the President of the United States of America. After this past unprecendented election, many Americans miss his presence in the Oval Office, so I decided to create a timeline of his very interesting and profound life. Check it out below! </p>

<h1> Time Series Chart </h1> 
<p> As a citizen of the world I am very concerned about Climate Change and Global Warming. I wanted to see how the two biggest carbon dioxide emitters, the USA and China, have been changing their carbon dioxide emissions. So I made a chart with Chart builder, check it out below.</p>

<h1> Interactive Online Map  </h1>
  <p> During February of 2017 I went to Los Angeles for the Israeli American Council national student conference. During that time I got to explore the city of Los Angeles a little bit before the conference started, and these are the places I got to visit. </p>
